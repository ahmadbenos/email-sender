<h1>Description</h1>
Send emails from a nodejs app using nodemailer and mailgun(email delivery service). 

The email sender can be anyone(user input) but the receiver is only one and it's me. So all emails are sent to my personal emails address.

Ignore the styling in this project, main purpose for building it is to send emails and test it. Just a quick design to make a fair enough.

<b>built using:</b>
<ul>
<li>express js</li>
<li>nodemailer</li>
<li>EJS</li>
<li>flash messages for alerts</li>
</ul>
